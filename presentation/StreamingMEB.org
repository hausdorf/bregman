* Why do we care about the minimum enclosing ball (MEB)

** It's nice to know about the "extent" of data
   
** How big/spread out is it?

** Given a set of image histograms, how diverse are they?

** Given a set of receivers, what power do I need to reach them all?

* Wy do we care about streaming?

** Small memory ($O(d)$), small time

** We may have a lot of dimensions, so get the processing done fast

** State of the art for $O(d)$ space:
   - approximation factor of up to 1.5 (Euclidean)

* Why do we care about Bregman divergences?

  $D_F(x, y) = F(x) - F(y) - \nabla F(y)(x - y)$

** Ok, great, why?

** A more general way of comparing data
   - Probability distributions (KL)
   - Signal processing (Itakura-Saito)
   - Geometric ($\ell_2^2$)

** Bregman Divergences appear a lot in Machine Learning

* Constraints

** Numeric Concerns
   Solving equations with Bregman div's can't be done explicitly

** Non-convexity
   Sometimes Bregman div's lead to optimizations that are not convex 

   (This is usually complicated but we sidestep this problem)

* The Main Approach

** When we get a point outside the current ball

** Create a new ball that contains the old ball and the new point

** This is the tough part 

* Trivial Streaming Algorithm

** Use first point as center, and use it forever

** Only update radius when new point is outside ball

* Better Streaming Algorithm

** Use curve that runs through new point $p$ and old center $c$

** Becomes a one-dimensional problem

** Run root finder (brentq) to find the points we need

* Better Streaming Algorithm (continued)

** Need intersection with ball ($p_{\text{far}}$)

** Need midpoint of $p_{\text{far}}$ and $p$

** Midpoint becomes new $c$

* Results

** Gold Standard: Nielsen-Nock

** Produces very close approx. to real MEB and is simple
